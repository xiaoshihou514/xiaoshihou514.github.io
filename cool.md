# 2024 winter ~ 2025 summer

Biggest practical project I've made by 2025 :\)

<ProjectCard title="jiyi" desc="Cross-platform encrypted voice note app" lang="Dart" lang_color="#00B3AA" href="https://github.com/xiaoshihou514/jiyi" />

For use in group projects:

For ricing, though I don't rice a lot now :\)

# 2023 winter ~ 2024 summer

I learned more about programming during the time. It was a time when I learned a bunch of new exciting new technologies.

<ProjectCard title="aristotle" desc="Easy to use gui frontend for ndpc" lang="C++" lang_color="#F34B7C" href="https://github.com/xiaoshihou514/aristotle" />

These two I was quite proud of at the time, I was hoping that X would adopt it. However, they seemed to consider Lean as a better alternative.

But it was a fun project and the logic was quite elegant.

Something I did in my free time:

<ProjectCard title="notes" desc="Extremely minimalist note taking app with flutter" lang="Dart" lang_color="#00B3AA" href="https://github.com/xiaoshihou514/notes" />

Had to say I didn't really figure out flutter at the time.

<ProjectCard title="squirrel.nvim" desc="Treesitter based navigation plugin" lang="Lua" lang_color="#00007F" href="https://github.com/xiaoshihou514/squirrel.nvim" />

My first published neovim plugin, quite hacky, and I haven't been using it much since.

# 2023 and previous

I first really started programming from 2021. I've made some small programs a bit later, some of the source code is still sitting around my hard drive somewhere:

- An enigma encryption program
- An alternative application launcher, written in Java Swing
- A broken gomoku AI, using brute force search and some pruning
- A barely started computer virus, with a client written in Go.

Since 2023, I have been using Neovim as my main editor. I was very active in the Neovim forum at the time and I began to maintain my own config and some of the plugins, most notably [guard.nvim](https://github.com/nvimdev/guard.nvim), originally written by [glepnir](https://github.com/glepnir), it's mostly under my maintenance by now.
