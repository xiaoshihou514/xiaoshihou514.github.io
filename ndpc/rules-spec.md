From x, y deduce x ^ y

```
1   x           [...]
2   y           [...]
3   x ^ y       [^I(1,2)]
```

### `->I` (Implication Introduction)

From "assuming x deduces y", deduce x -> y

```
1     x           [ass]
      <hard struggle>
2     y           [...]
3   x -> y        [->I(1,2)]
```

### `/I` (Or Introduction)

From x deduce x / ? or ? / x

```
1   x
2   x / y         [/I(1)]
```

### `~I` (Not Introduction)

From "assuming original deduces bottom" deduce its negation

```
1     x           [ass]
      <hard struggle>
2     F           [...]
3   ~x            [~I(1,2)]
```

### `~~I` (Double Negation Introduction)

From x deduce ~~x

```
1   x             [...]
2   ~(~(x))           [~~I(1)]
```

### `FI` (Falsity Introduction)

From x and ~x deduce F

```
1   x             [...]
2   ~x            [...]
3   F             [FI(1,2)]
```

### `TI` (Truth Introduction)

From nothing deduces T (but why would you do that :smirk:)

```
1   T             [TI]
```

### `<->I` (Equivalence Introduction)

From x -> y and y -> x deduce x <-> y

```
1   x -> y        [...]
2   y -> x        [...]
3   x <-> y       [<->I(1,2)]
```

### `existsI` (Exists Introduction)

From ùùì(x) deduce ‚àÉa ùùì(a)

```
1   ùùì(x)                [...]
2   exists x. (ùùì(x))    [existsI(1)]
```

### `forallI` (Forall Introduction)

From "c deduces f(c)" deduce ‚àÄx f(x)

```
1     c                 [forall I const]
      <hard struggle>
2     f(c)              [...]
3   forall x. (f(x))    [forallI(1,2)]
```
