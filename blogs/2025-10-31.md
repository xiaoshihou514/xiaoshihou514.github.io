# WTF is HKT

Higher order functions are functions that returns functions, higher order types are types that returns types. In a poor man's term:

```java
class List<T> // "HKT"
```

`List` takes in a type `T` and returns `List<T>`. But, we know that poor Java doesn't have HKT:

```java
<T> void foo(List<T> xs) {} // Good
<F, T> void bar(F<T> xs) {} // Bad
```

`F` is an HKT and Java does not allow it, we want:

```java
<F<?>, T> void bar(F<T> xs) {}
```

This is doable in Scala:

```scala
def foo[F[_], A, B](xs: F[A]): F[B] = ???
// so
def map[F[_] <: Seq[?], A, B](xs: F[A], f: A => B): F[B] = ???
```

Notice that in Kotlin, all `Iterable` map methods must uniformly return a `List`, breaking the shape.

Scala win, QED.
